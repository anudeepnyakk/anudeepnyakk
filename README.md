Hi, I’m Anudeep — AI Engineer (LLMs)

I build practical, production-grade systems using Large Language Models.
Focus areas: retrieval augmented generation (RAG), multilingual LLM pipelines, and open-source local model integration.

Right now working on Axiom AI — a multilingual RAG system with evaluated retrieval, fault tolerance, and secure-by-default design.
Docs, architecture, eval methodology, Docker deployment, and complete codebase are public and inspectable.

Strong interest in building domain-specialized AI systems

English + Hindi retrieval evaluation experience

Experience with ChromaDB, OpenAI API, local embeddings

Obsessed with measurement, correctness, attribution

What I care about: engineering clarity, reproducibility, real reliability… not just “prompting”.
