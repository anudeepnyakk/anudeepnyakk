# Hi, I’m Anudeep.

### **AI Engineer (LLM Infrastructure) & Builder.**

I architect production-grade systems that bridge the gap between "Demo AI" and "Enterprise AI." My focus is on **Latency, Reliability, and Non-Root Security**.

## 👑 The Flagship: Axiom AI

**A Production-Grade RAG Engine (<200ms Retrieval)**
Most RAG tutorials are slow and hallucinate. I built **[Axiom AI](https://github.com/anudeepnyakk/axiom-ai)** to prove that open-source infrastructure can beat proprietary black boxes.

| **Metric** | **Performance** | **Why it matters** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retrieval** | **<200ms** | Optimized in-memory caching & vector indexing (20x faster than standard). |
| **Recall** | **>95%** | Implemented **Hybrid Search** (BM25 + ChromaDB) to solve semantic drift. |
| **Security** | **Non-Root** | Containerized with **Docker (UID 1000)** for secure, compliant deployment. |
| **Audit** | **Verifiable** | Strict page-level citations enable instant manual verification of AI answers. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack

I don't just run notebooks; I build deployable software.

* **Core:** Python, LangChain, Streamlit
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Linux, Hugging Face Spaces
* **Data:** ChromaDB (Vector), BM25 (Keyword), PII Redaction Middleware

## 🚀 Philosophy

* **Engineering > Prompting:** I care about the runtime environment, not just the prompt.
* **Ship to Users:** If it only runs on localhost, it doesn't count.
* **Measurement:** "It feels fast" is not a metric. **<200ms** is a metric.
